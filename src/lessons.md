# Notes about intersection observers

    - allows to detect when elements come into the visible viewport of our screen
    - calls a callback function on the element we want to observe so that it animates on the page

# first time playing with intersection observer

    The goal is to to
        - change navigation highlight based on scroll position
        - lazy load content for cool effect
